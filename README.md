# Obsidian Full Calendar Plugin

Keep your calendar in your vault! This plugin integrates the [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) library into your Obsidian Vault so that you can keep your ever-changing daily schedule and special events and plans alongside your tasks and notes, and link freely between all of them. Each event is stored as a separate note with special frontmatter so you can take notes, form connections and add context to any event on your calendar.

The FullCalendar library is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) by [Adam Shaw](https://github.com/arshaw). It's an awesome piece of work, and it would not have been possible to make something like this plugin so easily without it.

## Coming soon

This plugin is in its early days -- here are some features I plan to work on next, in rough order of priority. If you have any ideas or want to vouch for one of these, [submit an issue](https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/issues)!

Surface tasks from throughout your vault on your calendar, and schedule them in blocks during your day to fill out your agenda. Inspired by (the as-yet-unreleased) [amie calendar](https://amie.so).
